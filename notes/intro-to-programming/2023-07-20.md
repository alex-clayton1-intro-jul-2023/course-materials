What we really work on will be specific to what business area we work on.

The closer to the user we are, the simpler we want it to be. Going for *Encapsulation*.
- Right now, we have almost no idea what is going on.

Order form you could fill out

Waterfall:
- Hot topic bc of the idea that Software Development can go through a methodology where requirements are figured out, then design things are decided, then programmers just implement it.


- can't put ad in paper saying i need 5 years of experience in some new technology
	- Just had to take some engineers and teach them the new stuff and let them explore

- Software construction is an ongoing native thing
	- People love Progressive bc of the stuff that we make
	- No SMEs when the iphone app came out. Had to make that stuff as they came out.


- Do not want to plan ahead of time
- *Always* try to address the needs of the current requirements. Do not do more than you are required to.

-  *GO FAST* - the faster we get code in front of the customer, the more $ we make
- *LIMIT LIABILITY* - We are going to keep adding new things (unexpected) and we can't break what is there.


[[Object Oriented Programming]]


Structs are stored on the stack (like int)
Objects get allocated on the heap (like classes)
