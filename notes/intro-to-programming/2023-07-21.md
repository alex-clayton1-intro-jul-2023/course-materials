Friday swag.

- Calculating Bonuses!
	- Loose coupling
	- Simulating dependencies in tests with test doubles
	- String Calculator p2
- Practice in .NET
	- Apply what you learned


code that doesnt compile can't be put into production which is nice. No risk of ppl going and changing stuff in previous things that totally breaks/changes things.


Going to teach us a good way to avoid coupling, this will be the way we build microservices.



Idea:
- Not in the world where life of software ends at end of semester, software will keep living and ppl will keep adding things to it.


Jeff doesn't go much into SOLID or CUPID principles bc then you start thinking your code needs to look a certain way when it doesn't.
- Just want to make the tests pass to start.
- Start with a simple thing and move on
	- Don't want to be a duck tape programmer and generalize everything / don't generalize things
	- But want to make the code work first, then refactor and make better.

Code is formal language for specifying the behavior of software
